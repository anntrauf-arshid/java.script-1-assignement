// <!-- Characteristics of Good Code Structure:

// Modularity: Breaking down the code into smaller, independent modules that perform specific tasks.
// Consistency: Following a consistent naming convention, indentation, and coding style throughout the codebase.
// Readability: Using clear and concise variable names, functions, and comments to explain the code's purpose and behavior.
// Reusability: Writing code that can be easily reused in other parts of the application or even in other projects. -->

// Example of Poorly Structured Code:
 let num1 =
 20;
 let num2=
 2;
 sum = num1+ 
 num2;
 console.log(sum);
//  wrrite code structure
let num =20;
 let num3=2;
 sum = num1+ num3;
 console.log(sum);
